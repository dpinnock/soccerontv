        <p>We regret to inform our users that the Soccer On TV website (http://www.sotlive.com) is closing down.</p>

            <h3>Postmortem</h3>
            <p>We are closing down our services for an indeterminate amount of time (likely forever... but who knows?). Me and my brother have been running this website in our spare time for a little over a year now. We both have 'real' full time jobs in completely different domains / industries unrelated to the soccer world. At this point in time neither of us have enough bandwidth to keep the site running at a level our users expect from us (nor can we run it at a level we expect from ourselves).</p>
            <p>We would like to sincerely thank our users from around the world for coming to us when they wanted to know what live soccer listings were currently playing on TV. It means a lot to us that even more than two or three people used the site on a daily basis and actually found it useful. It's a truly humbling experience to create something from scratch and then see others enjoy it as well.</p>
            <p>We want to specifically give a big thanks to the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer" target="_blank">/r/soccer</a> crowd. Without their input and positive feedback this site would never have grown to what it was, and for that we are truly grateful. We will still be lurkling the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer" target="_blank">/r/soccer</a> subreddit daily, so maybe we'll see you around :). You can still contact us via twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sotlive" target="_blank">@sotlive</a>, as always we love hearing from our users so feel free to reach out to us at anytime.</p>
            <p>For the programmers, technically inclinded, and data junkies out there we have open sourced the code that powered the site (some of it ain't pretty but it worked...) and released all historical TV listing data we accumulated since our inception. It was either open source the site and data or throw it away. Since we didn't get paid anything to develop and run the site and definitely don't make any money off of it, why not release what we have?</p>
