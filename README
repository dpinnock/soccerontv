RIP Soccer On TV (sotlive.com)

This web app is no longer in production and I am open sourcing the code. Some things are not very pretty but the app worked fine in production for over a year.

Brief technical explanation of technologies used
================================================
This was my first Python web application. This was also my first experience with MongoDB. MongoDB was not the right database engine to use for a web app of this type, since the data is very structured. A traditional RDBMS database would have been a better choice. Still was a cool learning experience and MongoDB didn't actually hinder anything I was doing but it definitely wasn't the best choice. Live and learn...

The JavaScript code I wrote for this is a bit messy. I just cranked it out and never changed anything after it worked. The jinja2 templates also are a bit of a mess, things could have been more structured and done differently.

Server / Database
=================
- Apache httpd server and mod_wsgi
- MongoDB

Python
======
- Flask
- pytz
- jinja2
- MongoKit
- shortuuid

JavaScript
==========
- Bootstrap plugins
- jQuery
- jQuery MultiSelect plugin

CSS
===
- Bootstrap

Free data
=========
- dump.json is all the game data entries we made while the web app was up, maybe someone can find it useful or interesting.
- Date values are stored as the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch (Jan 1, 1970) as a 64-bit integer. You will have to convert each date entry to a human readable date yourself.
- Even though all dates are stored without timezone information, all dates were entered against ET time zone. IE: Don't explicitly convert the date to the ET timezone, it will be wrong.
- Please note there are mistakes in some entries, so it's not 100% accurate or reliable.
